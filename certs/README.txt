This directory is intended for storing your SSL certificates (e.g., server.crt, server.key).

IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:
1. Never commit your private keys (.key files) to a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
2. Ensure this directory is added to your .gitignore file if you are using version control.
3. These files are typically used by your web server (Nginx, Apache) or local development server to enable HTTPS.
